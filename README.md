Ive struggled to complete the whole coding. Most of it works but there is an problem I cant figure out probably from my lack of memory. The result modal is not hidden and will not close, it stops the whole servey from working but commenting it out it works but the submit doesnt work afterwards. I cant figure out or rememebr what the solution would be to fix that. so because that doesnt work the heroku deploy doesnt either but I just kind of ran out of time figuring out how to fix it.
